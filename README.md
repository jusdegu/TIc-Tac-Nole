Description:
 For this project, various if-else and switch statements were used for the execution of control.
 The AI is a simple AI which only takes player selection into account; e.g. it does not know if 
 it has two of its own fruits in a row to create a third. 
 Button art was created by a friend, Mindy Goto.

 (Update - 5 July 2018) The AI has been upgraded! Upon entering checkWorld(), the AI first
 checks to see if it has two fruits in a row to create a tic tac toe; if not, it proceeds to
 check if the player has two fruits that can be blocked, otherwise it will pick a random
 available square. 100% of the code in this project, including AI, was written by myself. 

 Features not implemented:
 - An option to make the AI pick a square first.
 - A landscape orientation.

Mobile Programming Final Project

Tic-tac-toe app implemented using Java in Android Studio 3.1.3. Successfully emulates on Pixel API 26 and 27.

Description:
  APK is a simple tic-tac-toe app with not-so-smart-AI. Two game modes can be selected: player-vs-player and player-vs-computer.
  
  In lieu of the basic X and Os, I opted to use custom icons:
  
  Grapefruit:
  
  ![Grapefruit](/app/src/main/res/drawable/grape.png)
  
  
  Eggplant:
  
  ![Eggplant](/app/src/main/res/drawable/egg.png)
  
  Additional images included in the APK are sliced versions of the above fruits, which only appear upon three consecutive fruits in a row/diagonal (e.g. when one fruit wins).
